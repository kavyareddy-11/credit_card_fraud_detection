# credit_card_fraud_detection
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It addresses class imbalance with preprocessing, scaling, and stratified sampling. Model performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The pipeline includes training, saving with Joblib, and deployment-ready prediction.
